        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is for a quick and simple chicken burrito that can be made in only a few steps. This will take about 40 mintues in total to make and will serve four burritos</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons Gay Lea Butter</li>
            <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
            <li>Salt and ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Ivanhoe Old Cheddar</li>
            <li>1 cup diced green pepper</li>
            <li>2/3 cup Gay Lea Sour Cream</li>
            <li>1/3 cup salsa</li>
            <li>1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>4 large flour tortillas</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sliced black olives (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until no longer pink inside, about 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then transfer to a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Add 1 cup shredded cheese, bell pepper, sour cream, olives, salsa, jalape√±o, and cilantro to the chicken; stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Place 1/4 of the chicken mixture onto a tortilla. Fold and roll tortilla to completely enclose filling, then place it, seam-side down, in a small baking dish. Repeat to fill and roll remaining tortillas. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over top.</li>
            <li>Bake in center of the preheated oven until cheese is melted and tortillas are crispy, about 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
